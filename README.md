# Learning Golang

I develop software with the programming language Python since more than 20 years.

I like Python.

Nevertheless I want to try something new.

# Motivation

Why Golang? Because I am interested in Kubernetes, and in this context almost
all code is written in go.

I do web development since 2001. I am super happy that the browser wars are over.

Most things work flawlessly on all browsers.

I don't like the new JavaScript based applications. They are like old (and slow) native applications.

I like [htmx.org](//htmx.org), but up to now this is only a spare time thing, because we don't use it at work.

I am curious and want to try something new.

# Things I like in Golang

Declared, but not used variables are an error, not just a warning.

# About OOP

Golang does not support OOP.

When I was young I was facianted by OOP (object oriented programming). The thing
which facianted me the most, was that I did not understand it immediately, but I heard
great things about it over and over again. In the year 1996 I only had experience with
BASIC and Pascal.

Inheritance is great, but in most cases not needed.

I mostly write methods which handle http requests. These methods run for some milliseconds and then
return the result. I don't create complex and long living objects. I work with SQL databases and APIs. 
For both things I don't need inheritance.

I can live without OOP.
